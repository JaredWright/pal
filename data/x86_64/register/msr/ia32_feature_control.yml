                  Lock bit (R/WO): (1 = locked). When set, locks this MSR from
                  being written; writes to this bit will result in GP(0).
                  Note: Once the Lock bit is set, the contents of this register
                  cannot be modified.  Therefore the lock bit must be set after
                  configuring support for Intel Virtualization Technology and
                  prior to transferring control to an option ROM or the OS.
                  Hence, once the Lock bit is set, the entire
                  IA32_FEATURE_CONTROL contents are preserved across RESET when
                  PWRGOOD is not deasserted.
